## [Unreleased]

### Added
- First release as a package of its own. The code was the
  gravitational-wave layer of MilliHertzQML.jl (3.0.0-DEV) and keeps its
  history from the commit that separated the layers: the LISA noise model
  and the analytic TDI noise of the LDC toolbox, IMRPhenomA waveforms, the
  detector-response interface, LDC readers and A/E/T channels, whitening
  PSDs, the generation, pre-processing, labelling and payload-export
  stages, and the DeepSpaceTelemetry, CurvatureDistinguishability and
  CairoMakie extensions. It depends on StreamingInference.jl.
